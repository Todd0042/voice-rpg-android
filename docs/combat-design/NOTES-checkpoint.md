# Combat Design — State Notes (pre-retry checkpoint)

## Where we landed
Full analysis + data tables exist under `docs/combat-design/` (affinity-matrix, status-catalog,
spells, enemies, movesets, progression, balance harness, dead-code inventory, SPEC). Design so far
fixed all 15 combat issues + the 2 new ones (single-attack enemies; dead `level`/`xp`/no progression).

## Two corrections from the last exchange (important)
1. **Bad proof bar.** My earlier "no brick = PASS" test used a perfect Transcendental chant every
   turn, which trivially clears everything. The fights that actually hurt a player are at
   **Basic/Adept** resonance — that is where a construct/void/radiant wall feels like dead weight.
   Any re-validation MUST be run at Basic and Adept (and Master), not just Transcendental.
2. **The "give Lyra/Zephyr a PHYSICAL second lane" idea is CONTENT-FRAGILE.** It only holds because
   the 7 families were hand-picked. New story chapters (psychic "Doubt", a "Sound/Resonance" enemy
   type, new boss archetypes) could re-brick a fixed Duo/Trio/Quad roster. That was a "for now"
   patch — explicitly rejected by the user.

## The durable principle (content can add rewards, never walls)
The no-useless-ally guarantee must be a **property of the system, independent of the enemy table**:
- New content may only **add weak points (rewards)**; it must be **structurally incapable of
  creating a damage wall** against a fixed-roster member.
- Mechanism: **global impairment floor + resonance penetration active at EVERY tier**, applied
  *below* the matrix lookup:
    `effAffinity = clamp(base + pen(tier), FLOOR, 2.2)`
  - `FLOOR` is a system constant, not a per-family authored number → future families can't set it.
  - `pen(tier)` was previously gated so only Transcendental pierced; move the useful portion of
    penetration down to Master/adequate tiers so a resisted ally is never near-zero at the tiers a
    player realistically casts.
- Plus the existing affinity-immune utility/heal/control lane so a member is never reduced to
  "0.8× damage and nothing else."

## Retry prompt the user will send next
"Create a combat design that maintains the importance of the current combat resonance system —
nerd shit is rewarded above all else — but is balanced like a normal RPG. If something would be
immune, replace it with a 20% base damage reduction instead."

Interpretation for the retry:
- **I-1 stays sacred:** resonance (thesaurus/volume/inflection/novelty, 1.0–3.0×) is the #1 lever.
- **Normal-RPG balance:** bounded affinity (0.8–2.0-ish), defense, crit, statuses, progression,
  movesets — all the standard levers, just tuned so they never overwhelm chanting.
- **"Immune" → "0.8× (20% base reduction)"**: no blocked matchups/statuses anywhere; the worst case
  is a 20% damage reduction (and resisted-but-live statuses). This is already the design's floor;
  the retry likely wants it made the headline rule and everything re-tuned under it.

## Open items to resolve in the retry
- Re-run the I-3 (no useless ally) proof honestly at Basic/Adept/Master with the FLOOR + penetration
  model, across all 32 encounters + each legal fixed roster.
- Confirm penetration curve that keeps **knowledge (weakness pick) meaningful** vs skill:
  e.g. a Basic chant on a 2.0 weakness should still beat a mediocre chant on a resisted target.
- Keep weakness *discovery* + pocket-mode narration ("The Crypt Guard recoils — holy sears its bones!").
- Everything else (MP, defend-as-guard, statuses, drains, AOE number positions, movesets, boss
  phases, XP/level growth, C-lite pure `combat/` package, sim harness) stands as already designed.

## STATUS (post-approval): IMPLEMENTED Phase 2-4 (core doctrine)
- Approved model: affinity multiplies BASE only; resonance 1.0-3.0 is pure voice, never discounted.
  No penetration. "Immune" replaced by 20% base reduction (engine floor, content-proof).
- combat/ pure package implemented (AffinityTable/EnemyCodex/StatusCatalogTable/MovesetTable GENERATED
  from docs data + DamageResolver/StatusSystem/EnemyBrain/Progression hand-written).
- CombatViewModel rewired: MP cost enforced (soft fail), per-enemy affinity + defense + crit/variance,
  tier-gated statuses resisted-never-blocked, enemy movesets + cooldowns + boss phase unlocks,
  DRAIN/SUMMON/BUFF moves, guard+taunt, lifesteal, DoT begin-turn ticks (stun crawl, no deadlock),
  XP award to story-legal roster + level-ups into SavedCharacterStats, camp rest attrition (half heal;
  Midnight Vigil milestone keeps full restore), per-enemy/party floating-text slots, effectiveness +
  level-up + status narration for pocket mode.
- Tests: app/src/test/java/com/voicerpg/android/combat/* (resolver, status, progression, brain, doctrine).
  All ./gradlew test green.
